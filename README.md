1.00 FOREWORD: MY OWN HISTORY OF LEARNING QBASIC

My first 'serious' programming language was BASIC. Here is an example program...

100 CLS  
110 PRINT "Hello, world!"  
120 END

Later on, I switched to using 'modern day' BASIC's...where each line of code no longer needs to be preceeded with a line number...

CLS  
PRINT "Hello, world!"  
END
