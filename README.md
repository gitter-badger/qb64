-> QB64/QBASIC 64 program code

Here you will find simple QB64 example codes/programs; all of which you can practice studying/learning from.

-> FOREWORD: MY OWN HISTORY OF LEARNING QBASIC

NOTE: A 'first' programming language tends to stay with and haunt the programmer; quite possibly, for all the rest of their entire lifetime to come...; they really can't help but to compare every single 'new' programming language they come across...with that very 'first' programming language learned experience.

My first programming language was BASIC/Beginners All Purpose Symbollic Instruction Code. I practiced using it on a home based computer called: Tandy Radio Shack Color Computer II. This old BASIC interpreter version was called, MS BASIC/or, Microsoft BASIC. it used such things as: Line numbers/GOTO statements/GOSUB/RETURN sub-routines.

100 CLS  
110 PRINT "Hello, world!"  
120 END

Later on, I went and brought myself another computer called: Atari 520 STFM; on this machine I used a FASTBASIC interpreter; I found I didn't need to use line numbers/GOTO statements/GOSUB/RETURN/-etc.; because, instead, it was a modern BASIC version which used far more highly structured programming language techniques.

CLS  
PRINT "Hello, world!"  
END

Eventually, I went and brought myself a first PC. It came as a complete surprise to me one day when I went and discovered that on both the Windows 95/98 CD ROM; Microsoft had given away for FREE a QBASIC 1.1 interpreter program running on 32 bit platforms.

Later on, I upgraded my Windows platform to become Windows XP; and, then, I downloaded QBASIC from off the internet, instead; this time choosing QBASIC 4.5 compiler version. Compiler versions of the QBASIC allows you to create stand alone [.exe] files.

However, when I upgraded my Windows platform once more; this time to become Windows 7 Professional; which is a 64 bit OS/Operation System platform; very quickly, I discovered that neither QBASIC 1.1 interpreter/nor, QBASIC 4.5 compiler wouldn't run, anymore?! Therefore, I went and downloaded QB64 compiler program, instead; which still allows me to continue with doing QBASIC programming.

it could, of course, be argued that QBASIC is an 'old' programming language which is no longer relevant for today's purposes...namely, the age of the 'internet'; therefore, people should, in fact, be learning to use an 'internet based programming language', instead...such as, Javascript; frankly, I wouldn't entirely disagree with that statement.

However, when it comes to teaching 'beginners' who are entirely new to learning about different programming language techniques; then I find that QBASIC is a straight forwards, simple and easy programming language to learn. Furthermore, the program can be FREEly download over the internet; the program size is small; and, the code executes very quickly, indeed; which is why its called, QuickBASIC. ;-)
